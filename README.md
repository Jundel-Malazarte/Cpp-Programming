# C++ Programming Exercises

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of **C++ exercises** designed to take you from beginner to professional level. It covers everything from **basic fundamentals** to **advanced topics**, helping you master the C++ programming language through hands-on practice.

## Learning Path

- **Beginner Level**: Basic syntax, data types, variables, and control flow
- **Intermediate Level**: Functions, pointers, arrays, and object-oriented programming (OOP)
- **Advanced Level**: Data structures, algorithms, memory management, and design patterns

## Repository Structure

Each exercise is organized in its own folder, containing:
- `.cpp` source file with the implementation
- Executable file for running the program

## How to Use

1. Navigate to any exercise folder
2. Review the `.cpp` file to understand the problem
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
4. Run the executable to see the output
5. Modify and experiment to deepen your understanding

## Getting Started

```bash
# Compile a C++ file
g++ -o output_name filename.cpp

# Run the executable
./output_name
```

## Exercises Included

- **Two Sum**: Classic array manipulation problem
- **Hello World**: Introduction to C++ basics
